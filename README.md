Welcome to **MERN-Potato**! This repository is a hyper-accelerated, four-week crucible designed exclusively for mastering the **MERN Stack** (MySQL, Express.js, React Native, Node.js) through intensive, hands-on development.

> Yes, I know It's **MERN** for **`MongoDB`**, **`Express.js`**, **`React`**, and **`Node.js`** 🧐 but I replace the **`MongoDB`** to **`MySQL`**, so lets learn somthing new 😉

The goal is to go from zero to a complete, full-stack **C.R.U.D.** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application in four weeks, working entirely in a local development environment.

## 🛠️ Local Prerequisites

Before diving into Week 1, ensure you have the following essential local tools installed and running:
* **Node.js** (with npm)
* **MySQL Server** (via XAMPP/MAMP or standalone)
* **Expo CLI** (for React Native development)

## 🚀 The Stack
* **Database:** MySQL (Local Installation)
* **Backend/API:** Express.js (Node.js)
* **Frontend (Mobile & Web Admin):** React Native (via Expo/React Native Web)

## 🎯 Project Goals

We will use the patient admission scenario as a concrete problem space to practice and solidify the following technical skills:
1.  Asynchronous JavaScript, Promises, and robust **Data Flow**.
2.  Creating secure, RESTful API endpoints (**Full CRUD**).
3.  Connecting Express.js to a local **MySQL database** instance.
4.  React Hooks and **Global State Management** (Context/Zustand).
5.  Building mobile-first interfaces and the initial foundation for **User Authentication**.

The detailed, day-by-day plan can be found in [**`PLAN.md`**](https://github.com/woliul/mern-potato/blob/main/PLAN.md).
